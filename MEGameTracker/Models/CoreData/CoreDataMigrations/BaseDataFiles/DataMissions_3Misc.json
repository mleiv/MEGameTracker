Instead, he suggests heading into the deep to meet Leviathan via the Triton ADS mech left over from the downed ship's cargo. It just needs to be powered up. \n\nThere is another Reaper battle while you gather the batteries to power up the mech. Once it is charged, you can use the mech to help clear out remaining enemies, then simply walk off the downed ship into the water and once you hit the bottom, follow the flares until you find Leviathan. \n\nHe does not want to join the war effort, and tries to take you over, but - as always - Shepard resists, and Leviathan is impressed enough to agree to help.",
