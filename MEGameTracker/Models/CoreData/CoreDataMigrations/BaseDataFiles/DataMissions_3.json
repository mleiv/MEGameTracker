In an introduction to gameplay, you flee with [megametracker://person?id=P1.Anderson] through the wreckage of Vancouver until the Normandy picks you up, with your former teammate [megametracker://person?id=S1.Ashley] or [megametracker://person?id=S1.Kaidan], and a new squad member, [megametracker://person?id=S3.Vega]. Anderson elects to stay behind to lead the resistance, but orders you to head to the Citadel and ask for help from the Council.",
