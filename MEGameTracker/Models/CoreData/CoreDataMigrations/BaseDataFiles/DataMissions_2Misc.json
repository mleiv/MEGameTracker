Continue upstairs to the power relay (killing the varren) and turn it off also. Go past the security beams where you hear Dr. Kenson and find an explosive under an overhead pipe and shoot it. This will ignite vents across the building, but you can use valves placed conveniently nearby to redirect the plasma and move through. Go upstairs and outside. Sneak behind the truck to cut the power relay and disable the security beams, then climb up over the truck to go inside the door. Head to the hangar and use the controls to move the crane out of the way and then activate the vehicle lift below to access the lower level. Head back to Kenson's cell."
